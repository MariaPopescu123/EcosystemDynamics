## 1-D Spatial Model Tutorial go through code and think about what is on the board and match to code to see what is going on and then link the 2 and then at the beginning of class on thrusday 2/27 we walk through assignment the code is a simplification of the problem

This tutorial guides you through the calculation of the advection, diffusion, and reaction processes necessary to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics in an ecosystem.

The example is for phytoplankton dynamics in a lake that we simulate as having a vertical dimension (depth). Phytoplankton will sink (advection), diffuse, grow (reaction), and die (reaction).

#tutorial is designed to teach, 

## Diagram of spatial fluxes

The following figure diagrams the concept of 

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{A}\frac{\partial (A\cdot{J})}{\partial{x}}$$

where J is the flux density, and A is the area of the box

![](img/divergence_figure.png)
This generic calculation of a flux divergence can be applied to advection and diffusion.

- advection: directed movement.  
- diffusion (also called dispersion): random movement that reduces concentration gradients.  

## Example of advection flux calculation

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{A}\frac{\partial (u A C)}{\partial{x}}$$

First, define our states at three depths.

```{r}
PHYTO <- c(10, 0, 10)
#three box problem the top box has 10 phytos middle box has 0 phytos and bottom has 10 phytos#
```

Next, define a few parameters.

- `advection_flux_density_top`: the advection flux density (mmolC/m2/day) into the top box
- `area`: the surface area (m2) of each box (we are assuming constant area for each depth of 100 m2)
- `u`: our vertical velocity rate (m/day); i.e., how far a mmolC travels in one day
- `delx`: is the length of the boxes (m)

```{r}
#specify advection into top box is an essential parameter it is a boundary condition we do not need one at the bottom because it is calcularted internally. top boundary condition is needed for advection and bottom is internally calculated so its not needed##
advection_flux_density_top <- 0 #the advection flux density (mmolC/m2/day) into the top box
area <- 100 #the surface area (m2) of each box (we are assuming constant area for each depth of 100 m2)
u <- 0.2 #advection rate# our vertical velocity rate (m/day); i.e., how far a mmolC travels in one day
delx <- 0.25 #thickness#is the length of the boxes (m)
```


Now calculate the total flux at each interface between the boxes.  The units of this calculation are m/day * mmolC/m3 * m2 = mmolC / day 

$$ (u\cdot{A}\cdot{C})$$

```{r}
advection_flux <- u * PHYTO * area #calc advection flux
```

But this does not include the flux into the top of the top box. Since advection only flow in one direction we do not need a flux at the bottom of the bottom box.  Now include the flux into the top box


```{r}
advection_flux_top <- advection_flux_density_top * area #advection flux at top#
advection_flux <- c(advection_flux_top, advection_flux) #combine advection flux together#
```

Does the flux density make sense? 

Do the highest fluxes occur out of the boxes with the largest stocks?


```{r}
#does this make sense its 10 0 and 10 and our flux in is zero so our advection from top box into second box is 200 because of advection. 200 top to middle and 0 from middle to bottom box bc there is nothing in it and then there is 200 coming out of the bottom box# four values for advection flux but only 3 phyto states ?????
advection_flux
PHYTO
```

*Check for understanding:* Why are there four values for the `advection_flux` but only three for the PHYTO state?

Now, we want to figure out the net advection flux, also called the flux divergence. This requires looking at the difference between the inputs at the top of a box and the outputs at the bottom. Using the `diff` function, we can easily do this on the entire vector of PHYTO states.

$$ \partial (u\cdot{A}\cdot{C}) $$  


```{r}
#diff function looks one cell down and automatically does the subtraction for us 
diff(advection_flux)
```

In this example:

- box 1:  200 more mmol/day are leaving the bottom than coming the top.  
- box 2: 200 more mmol/day are coming in the top and leaving the bottom.   
- box 3: 200 more mmol/day  are leaving the bottom than coming the top.  

Since a positive value from the diff function means that more is leaving than coming in, we need to multiply the flux density by -1 so that the mass is correctly subtracted from the box.

$$ -\partial (u\cdot{A}\cdot{C})$$


```{r}
advection <- -diff(advection_flux)
```


Finally, intuitively, two boxes have the same net advection fluxes but one box is bigger than another box then the bigger box should have a smaller change in its concentration. Therefore we divide by the length of the box (in our example all boxes have the same length) and the area of the box (which is the same for all boxes in our example and is the middle of the box). The negative is moved to the front. 

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{A}\frac{\partial (u\cdot{A}\cdot{C})}{\partial{x}}$$

```{r}
advection <- -(1/area)*(diff(advection_flux) / delx) 
#loss in top box gain in middle box and loss in bottom box#
```

The resulting units are mmolC / (m3 * day), which is a change in concentration over time (our derviative)

Now we have the change in PHYTO for each box due to advection.  

*Check for understanding:* Which box is gaining the most PHYTO from advection?  Why?

```{r}
advection
```

## Example of diffusion flux calculation

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{A}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}(A\cdot{D}\cdot\frac{\partial C}{\partial x})$$


First, we are going to use the same PHYTO states as used for the advection calculation.

```{r}
PHYTO #10 in box one 0 in box 2 10 in box 3#
```

Next, define a few parameters.

- `D`: the diffusion rate parameter (1/day)
- `area`: the surface area (m2) of each box (we are assuming constant area for each depth)
- `top_diffusion_gradient`: The diffusion gradient from the top of the top box (mmolC/m)
- `bottom_diffusion_gradient`: The diffusion gradient from the bottom of the bottom box (mmolC/m)
- `delx`: is the length of the boxes (m)

```{r}
#we need top and bottom bc diffusion can go up nd down#
D <- 0.01
area <- 100
top_diffusion_gradient <- 0.0
bottom_diffusion_gradient <- 0.0
delx <- 0.25
```

Now calculate the gradient in concentration between each box.

$$ \partial C$$

```{r}
#gradient can be calculated using diff#
gradient_between_boxes <- diff(PHYTO) 
```


But this does not include the concentration gradient at the top of the top box. Since diffusion can flow up or down we also need to include the gradient at the bottom.  Think of this as diffusion out of the "system" either up or down.  In our example, we are assuming that the gradient is zero at the boundaries of the system so there isn't any loss of mass outside the system due to diffusion (note that we do have a loss of mass out the bottom of the box due to advection)

```{r}
#ultimate graident contains top and bottom#
gradient <- c(top_diffusion_gradient, gradient_between_boxes, bottom_diffusion_gradient)
```

The gradient depends on the distances between the middle of the boxes.

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial x}$$

```{r}
gradient <- gradient / delx
```

The units are mmolC / m3 * 1/m = mmolC / m2

Let's compare the gradient to the PHYTOS. 

*Check for understanding:* Why are there four values for the gradient but only three for PHYTO?

```{r}
gradient
PHYTO
```

The flux from diffusion is proportional to the size of the gradient. Importantly, a high gradient means that the box below is higher than the box above, so the mass will flow from the box with more concentration to the box with less concentration. This is against the gradient, so a negative sign is needed so concentration is removed from the box with more concentration.

$$ (A\cdot{-D}\cdot\frac{\partial C}{\partial x})$$

```{r}
diffusion_flux <- area * -D * gradient
```


The units are m2 * 1/day * (mmolC / m3 * 1/m) = mmolC / day

Now we want to figure out the **net** diffusion flux for each box, also called the **flux divergence**, or how much is the diffusion changing from the top to bottom of the box.

$$ \partial(A\cdot{-D}\cdot\frac{\partial C}{\partial x})$$
This requires looking at the difference between the inputs at the top of a box and the outputs at the bottom.  This can be easily done on the entire vector of PHYTO states using the `diff` function.  This will automatically subtract box i from i+1.  

```{r}
#change in the gradient over space #
diff(diffusion_flux)
```

In this example:

- box 1: 40 more mmolC/day are leaving than coming in 
- box 2: 80 more mmolC/day are coming in than leaving  
- box 3: 40 more mmolC/day are leaving than coming in  


It needs to be multipled by -1 because if the diffusion out the bottom is higher than the diffusion in the top then simple subtraction of results a positive number. BUT if diffusion is higher out than it, the net flux should be negative because the box is a net loss of PHYTO.  So we multiply by -1.

```{r}
-diff(diffusion_flux)
```

Finally, intuitively, two boxes have the same net diffusion fluxes but one box is bigger than another box then the bigger box should have a smaller change in is concentration. Therefore we divide by the length of the box (in our example all boxes have the same length) and the area.  The negative sign is moved to the front.

$$ \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{A}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x}}(A\cdot{-D}\cdot\frac{\partial C}{\partial x})$$

```{r}
diffusion <- - (1 / area) * (diff(diffusion_flux) / delx)
```

1/m2 * 1/m * m2 * 1/day * (mmolC / m3 * 1/m) = mmolC / (m3 * day)

Now we have the change in PHYTO for each box due to diffusion  

*Check for understanding:* Which box is gaining the most PHYTO from diffusion?  Why?

```{r}
#changes of concentrations within each box#
diffusion
```

## Reaction

The reactions are the processes occurring within a box.  In our simple model, PHYTOS grow in response to light and die.  

1) The light at the surface is defined using a sin wave where t is the day of the simulation (this is the same function as the NPZD model)

```{r}
t <- 1
PAR_surface   <- 0.5 * (540 + 440 * sin(2 * pi * t / 365 - 1.4))
```

2) The light in each box is defined by the amount of water above it.  We calculate the light in the middle of each box using an exponential decay.  The `light_extinction` parameter is the decay parameter (similar to the k parameter in our decomposition model from Lab 3).  We are assuming our lake is 1 m meters deep and we have boxes that start at 0, 0.25, 0.5  meters deep.  The code `seq(delx/2, lake_depth - (delx/2), by = delx)` calculates the depth of the middle of the boxes.

```{r}
light_extinction <- 0.9 #less light as you go down
lake_depth <- 0.75 #are 3m deep
layer_mid_depths <- seq(delx/2, lake_depth - (delx/2), by = delx) 
layer_PAR <- PAR_surface * exp(-light_extinction * layer_mid_depths)
#PAR extinguishes wiht depth so growth rates extinguish with depth#
```

```{r}
plot(layer_mid_depths,layer_PAR , type = "l", xlab = "Lake depth (m)", ylab = "PAR")
```

Carbon uptake is the proportional to the size of the PHYTO stock at each depth (PHYTOS are the worker) with a Michaelis–Menten light limitation multiplier (just like the NPZD model)

```{r}
maxUptake <- 2 #growth rate#
ksPAR <- 140
C_Uptake <- maxUptake *  PHYTO * (layer_PAR / (layer_PAR + ksPAR))  #for each layer
C_Uptake
```

*Check for understanding:* Why is C_Uptake zero in the middle box?  Why is it lower for the bottom box?

PHYTOS die for many different reasons that we represent using a non-linear closure term.

```{r}
mortalityRate <- 0.05 #how we would kill our phytos for each box
Mortality <- mortalityRate * PHYTO^2
```

Our net reaction is

```{r}
reaction <- C_Uptake - Mortality #mortality exceeds growth in bottom box
```

## Combining it together 

Our PHYTO along with the advection, diffusion and reaction rates for each box are:

```{r}
print("PHYTO")
PHYTO
print("Advection")
advection
print("Diffusion")
diffusion
print("Reaction")
reaction
```
*Check understanding:* Do these values make sense


So we can add together to get our differential equation.

```{r}
dPHYTO_dt <- advection + diffusion + reaction
dPHYTO_dt
```


#TRADE OFF BETWEEN SPACE AND TIME, IF YOU HAVE VERY SMALL BOXES YOU CANT HAVE LARGE TIMESTEPS, if you do not allign these you have to decrease time step as you decrease box size if you do not ur model will fail becasue you would have magically moving mass bc rate of movement through system would be shroter than time

## Goals:

-           Describe and apply a numerical approach to simulating both space and time using differential equations
-           Conceptualize how plankton concentrations are sensitive to the light environment  
-           Apply the concept of light extinction and Beer’s Law to an ecosystem model 
-           Modify our existing vertical lake model for a new application (ocean carbon burial).  

## Part 1: Space and time models

**Question 1:** 

Provide an example model application when you would potentially need the following dimensions in ecosystem modeling:

**Answer 1:**
hint 0 d is that there is no concept of space and only time like our NZPD model it has no space only time
a)         0-D
b)         1-D
hint 1D model is the lake problem
c)         2-D
hint is this could work in a dream downstream and vertical modement everything is either gravity or downstream advect in direction of flow and graityy 
d)         3-D
jsut do every direction

**Question 2:**  

Describe the concept of flux divergence (see text).  

**Answer 2:**
net of advective processes acting on a box
**Question 3:** 

What is the difference between advection and diffusion?

**Answer 3:**
advection is directional
**Question 4:**  

Use the code that we covered in class to simulate the lake phytoplankton population for three years using 3 boxes instead of 48 boxes in the vertical dimension. How is your answer sensitive to the number of boxes that you use?  (think about how the idea of the number of vertical boxes compares to the idea of time steps when solving differential equations)
#take code and simualte 3 boxes instead of 48 if we want to examine the entire phytoplanton compare the plot tha tlooks like a si wave w 48 boxes and compare it to the odel with a 3 boxes and see how model responds to alteration in # boxes 

**Answer 4:**

**Question 5:** 

To control water quality, the amount of sediment coming into the lake has been reduced.  Decreasing the sediment increases the light penetration, which decreases the light extinction coefficient from 0.9 to 0.1.  Using your model, plot and describe how this alters the phytoplankton in the water column.  Describe the reasons for the model behavior. **Be sure to use 48 vertical boxes** 
#we cleaned the water more light penetrates deeper what does that do quinn hint is literally change a single parameter

**Answer 5:**
```{r}
#INSERT CODE TO SOLVE
```

## Part 2: Ocean carbon burial

**Question 6:** 
#we are modeling our ocean. solution is to simplify the code and bring in the soil decomposition model modify model so it only has advection and decomposition no growth no phytos and come in and put code for flux out bottom is list(c(dphytodt but it will be different for this ocean model and then within the list (c(dPHYTO_dt), c(advection_flux[numboxes]))))
#measure only decomp in each box and have outflux as extra thing like CLA in NZPD model and plot that over time
#this problem simplifies down what he has already given us#

You can use the phytoplankton code as a guide for solving this question.  Importantly, you will be simplifying the existing code. The question follows Question 6.7.3 in S&H.

The biological pump in the ocean is a component of the ocean carbon sink.  The biological pump depends on primary production in the upper ocean sinking and escaping mineralization.  If it is mineralized, then the CO2 returns to the atmosphere, thus not resulting in the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.  We are interested in how the rate of dead organic matter sinking influences the vertical distribution of dead organic matter in the ocean.

The ocean has a euphotic zone and an aphotic zone.  The euphotic zone has light and is where photosynthesis occurs (the depth of this zone is not relevant to this problem). The aphotic zone has no light, so only mineralization occurs. It is 400 m thick (i.e., 400 m deep).  

Implement a numerical solution of dead organic matter sinking through the aphotic part of an oceanic water column. Dead organic matter is raining down from the productive euphotic zone.  As it sinks through the water column, it is being degraded through mineralization.  In building your model, assume that:

- The dead organic matter had a constant sinking velocity of (parameter u) of 50 m day-1.  The sinking of the dead organic matter is an advective process.   
- Model the degradation of dead organic matter as a first-order decay process, with a degradation rate (k) of 0.2 day-1.   
- The flux of dead organic matter from the euphotic zone, i.e. the upper boundary for our model, is prescribed as 100 mmol C m-2 day-1.  At the lower end of the water column, material leaves the water column to settle on the bottom.   
- There is no diffusive mixing.   
- Remember how you can add a second list to the output that is returned by your differential equation model function (see the PAR and CHL example in the NPZD model).  Add the advective flux for the only last layer as an extra output.  This is the carbon burial rate.   

Run the model for a sufficiently long time so that the concentrations of dead organic matter stop changing over time.

Provide the code and solve your model.

**Answer 6:**
```{r}
#INSERT CODE TO SOLVE AND PLOT ANSWER

```

**Question 7:**  

Plot the output of your model as a contour plot with time on the x-axis and depth on the y-axis.  The color should be the organic matter concentration. You will use the contour plot code provided in class as the base for the plot.

**Answer 7:**
```{r}
#Plot

## Part 3: Sensitivity of burial rates

How is the burial rate sensitive to the sinking rate? Reduce the sinking rate by half (from 50 m/s to 25 m/s) and simulate the burial rate. 

**Question 8:**

Create a plot that includes the burial rate with a 50 m/s and 25 m/s sinking rate.  Be sure to include a legend and axis labels. As an example of code for placing a legend: `legend("topright", c("50 m/s", "25 m/s"), col = c("black", "red"), lty = c("solid","solid"))`,  Your plot should be a line graph with two lines.
