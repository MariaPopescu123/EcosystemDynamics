# Microbial modeling: reading modeling journal paper

## Goals of lab

- Prepare to build the microbial model in the subsequent lab exercise.  
-	Practice translating a published model to model code
-	Practice building conceptual models

## Assignment

In this module, you will use your experience building models to construct a soil decomposition model based on the model description in a published paper.

Before the lab, read the [Allison et al. (2010)] paper and supplemental information (https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo846). Then, come to class ready to build the two models (an Enzyme-driven model and a Conventional model) described in the paper.

Please come to class ready to discuss the paper and decide on the key finding that you'd like to reproduce.

In preparation for model building, please answer the following questions (Due by the end of lab).

**Question 1:**

What is the model currency?

**Answer 1:**
carbon mg g-1 or mg cm-3 

**Question 2:** 

What is the model time scale?

**Answer 2:**

30 years for simulation but units are in hours

**Question 3:**  

What is the model spatial scale?

**Answer 3:**
cm-3 though there are global implications

**Question 4:**

What are the model states?

**Answer 4:**
Soil organic carbon 
dissolved organic carbon 
Microbial Inorganic Carbon (MIC)/microbial biomass
Enzyme Pools (ENZ)

**Question 5:**

What are the model fluxes?

**Answer 5:**
input SOC
decomp
asisimilation
co2 output
eproduction
eloss
inputDOC
MICtoSOC
MICtoDOC

**Question 6:**

What are the forcing inputs (environmental drivers) to the model?

**Answer 6:**
temperature 
**Question 7:**
What initial conditions does the model require?

**Answer 7:**
SOC (100), DOC (0.5), MIC (0.5), Enz (0.01), 
from the spin-up

SOC (111.876) DOC (0.00144928) MIC (2.19159) ENZ (0.0109579) 

**Question 8:** 

What are the model parameters?

**Answer 8:**
endTime
interval
temp
inputSOC
inputDOC
rdeath
rEnzProd
rEnzLoss
MICtoSOC
CUE0
CUEslope
Vmax0
Vmaxuptake0
Km0
Kmuptake0
Kmslope
Kmuptakeslope
Ea
Eauptake

**Question 9:**

Draw a conceptual diagram of the Enzyme-driven model and label the fluxes with a number (f#).  Be sure to link to your figure in this Markdown, so it appears in the HTML you submit.

**Answer 9:**

**Question 10:**

Write the differential equations for the Enzyme-driven model states using the flux numbers from question 9. 

**Answer 10:**
dMIC/dt = f1 * CUE - f3 - f4

dENZ/dt = f4 - f5

dSOC/dt = f6+ f3 * f7 - f8

dDOC/dt = f9 + f3 *(F10) + f8 + f5 - f1
